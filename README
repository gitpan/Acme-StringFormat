NAME
    Acme::StringFormat - Smart interface to sprintf()

VERSION
    This document describes Acme::StringFormat version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::StringFormat;

        # enable 'sprintf' operator in the scope

        say '[%s][%s]' % 'foo' % 'bar'; # => [foo][bar]

DESCRIPTION
    I had a desire for a "format operator" of other languages. Now this
    pragmatic module provides Perl with a format operator "%", which is
    equivalent to "sprintf()".

INTERFACE
  "use Acme::StringFormat;"
    Enables the format operator in the scope;

  "no Acme::StringFormat;"
    Disables the format operator in the rest of the scope;

DIAGNOSTICS
    "Arguments mismatch for Acme::StringFormat"
        "printf" warnings.

        Too few format parameters or too many format arguments.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Acme::StringFormat requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    Perl 5.10.0 or later, and a C compiler.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    No bugs have been reported.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-acme-stringformat@rt.cpan.org/", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/>.

SEE ALSO

    The following languages (or libraries) also provide "%" format
    operators:
